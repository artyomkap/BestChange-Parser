# BestChange-Parser
An asynchronous Python-based parser for extracting real-time exchange rate data from the BestChange API and saving it to a database.  This project supports automatic currency pair generation, scheduled updates, and safe insertion of rates into a local database (SQLite, but can be adapted to MySQL/PostgreSQL).
